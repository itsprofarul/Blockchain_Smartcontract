# 📌 Blockchain_Smartcontract

## **SIUT University - Blockchain Dashboard**
🚀 A **simple blockchain-based transaction system** with a **web dashboard** built using **Flask & Python**.

---

## **🔹 Project Overview**
This project demonstrates how **blockchain technology** can be used for **secure transactions and mining**.
The **dashboard** allows users to:

✅ **Add Transactions** (Sender, Recipient, and Amount)  
✅ **Mine Blocks** using **Proof of Work (PoW)**  
✅ **View the Blockchain** in JSON format  
✅ **Dark Mode Support** 🌙  
✅ **Live Auto Refresh for Blockchain Data**  
✅ **GitHub Integration for Open Collaboration**  

---

## **🔹 Aim of This Project**
The primary aim of this project is to **develop a blockchain-based transaction system** that allows users to:
✔ **Add and verify transactions**  
✔ **Mine blocks using PoW**  
✔ **Visualize blockchain data through a user-friendly web interface**  

Additionally, it serves as a **foundation for smart contract integration** in future implementations.

---

## **🔹 Objectives**
1️⃣ **Develop a Web-Based Blockchain Dashboard**  
   - Build an **interactive dashboard** where users can **add transactions, mine blocks, and view the blockchain** dynamically.  

2️⃣ **Implement Proof of Work (PoW) Mechanism**  
   - Ensure secure and verifiable **block creation** by requiring a computational proof, simulating the PoW used in major blockchains like Bitcoin.  

3️⃣ **Validate and Secure Transactions**  
   - **Prevent empty transactions** (i.e., sender, recipient, and amount should be valid).  
   - Ensure that **each transaction follows predefined rules**, mimicking **smart contract validation**.  

4️⃣ **Enable UI Features for Better User Experience**  
   - **Dark Mode toggle** for better readability.  
   - **Auto-refresh option** for real-time blockchain updates.  

5️⃣ **Create a Foundation for Future Smart Contract Integration**  
   - The project mimics a **basic smart contract system** where transactions must meet conditions before being executed.  
   - This can later be extended to **Ethereum smart contracts** using Solidity and Web3.  

---

## **🔹 Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, JSON  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap  
- **Blockchain Concept**: Proof of Work (PoW), Hashing  

---

## **🔹 Features & Functionality**
### 1️⃣ Add Transactions  
- Users enter Sender, Recipient, and Amount.  
- Transactions must be **valid** (no empty values).  

### 2️⃣ Mine Blocks  
- A block is **created only if transactions exist**.  
- Uses **Proof of Work (PoW)** for mining.  

### 3️⃣ View Blockchain  
- Displays the current blockchain in **JSON format**.  
- **Auto-refresh option** updates the blockchain live.  

### 4️⃣ Dark Mode  
- Toggle between **Light & Dark Mode** for a better UI experience.  

### 5️⃣ GitHub Integration  
- **Track progress** and contribute via **GitHub repository**.  

---

## **🔹 Expected Outcomes**
✅ A fully functional **blockchain web application** with **transaction management** and **PoW-based mining**.  
✅ Improved understanding of **blockchain principles**, including **PoW mining, transaction validation, and block creation**.  
✅ A modular and scalable foundation for **future smart contract integration**.  
✅ GitHub-based open collaboration for learning and development.
